There's something oddly magical about starting a day in the twilight of pre-dawn. Don't get me wrong, it's perfectly miserable and you *just know* you'll be exhausted by the time the day ends, but every now and again, it's worth it to be present when the sun rises -- for all the problems in the world, it is a nice reminder of how small we (and they) truly are.  It helps to put things in perspective to realize that we are nothing more than small specks of cosmic dust, in the form of hairless apes running around on the surface of a slightly bigger speck of dust that's circling around a burning ball of gas.

I don't know about you, but looking through that frame always makes my problems seem silly.

Anyway, enough musing on cosmic (in)significance. Welcome to my blog, *Re: Missives*! Much like myself, it is very much a work in progress, but we all need to start somewhere, right? Here's where I'll be putting down thoughts, detailing things I'm working on and at, and perhaps providing some useful information to anyone who stumbles upon it. Regardless of where, or when, you're reading this, I hope you find it useful, entertaining, or preferrably, a bit of both.

Cheers, Devin
